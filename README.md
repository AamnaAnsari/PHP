# PHP

Hello Everyone!
My name is Aamna Ansari. Today, we will talk about abstract class in PHP.
An abstract class in PHP is a class that cannot be instantiated (created) on its own. You can't create objects directly from an abstract class, Instead you must create subclass that extends abstract class.
Abstract classes are useful for defining a common interface and shared functionality for a group of related classes.

Here are some key points about abstract classes:

1. Abstract Methods: An abstract class can contain abstract methods, which are methods without a body. Subclasses that extend the abstract class must provide implementations for these abstract methods.

2. Concrete Methods: An abstract class can also contain regular (concrete) methods with implementations that can be inherited by subclasses.

3. Properties: Abstract classes can have properties, and these can be inherited by subclasses.
